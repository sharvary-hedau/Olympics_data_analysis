# Olympics-Data-Analysis
This project involves analyzing Olympic data using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to gain insights and make predictions based on various features of the athletes and events. Models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and CatBoost. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation. All models were evaluated, with CatBoost providing the best performance at 85% accuracy. The results help understand patterns in Olympic performance and predict outcomes based on historical data. The project also includes the development of a web app using Streamlit, which allows users to interactively explore data and make predictions based on historical analysis.
